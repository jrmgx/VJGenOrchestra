# Create Visualizer

## When to use

When the intent is to create a new visualizer from scratch, use these instructions.

## Instructions

### General rules

To get a working visualizer, follow these rules:

 - You must render onto the Canvas passed to `render(canvas, ctx, audio, container, options, engine)`
 - Each visualizer renders to its own offscreen canvas; the engine composites all active ones onto the main canvas
 - Prefer transparent backgrounds (clearRect or alpha compositing) so layers blend when multiple visualizers are active
 - Get audio from the passed `audio` object: `audio.getByteFrequencyData()`, `audio.analyser`, or pre-filtered `audio.kick`, `audio.bass`, `audio.mid`, `audio.high` (see SimpleViz for reference)
 - For custom canvases (e.g. Three.js), use the container to inject your canvas; the engine will composite it
 - Post-processors: export `postProcess: true` and receive the current composite as 7th param: `render(canvas, ctx, audio, container, options, engine, sourceCanvas)`. Use sourceCanvas as texture/source. Your output replaces all previous layers on the main canvas; the chain then continues with normal merging for visualizers after you. Example: A, B, post C, D → C receives A+B merged, C replaces them, final = C+D merged.
 - Options: add `options.html` in your visualizer folder. Use `name` or `id` on inputs for keys. Values are passed as `options` (5th param). Example: `<input type="range" name="speed" min="0" max="2" value="1">` → `options.speed`. The engine injects `engine/options.css` for shared styles (transparent bg, sans-serif bold black text, label as block).

### Custom option groups (hidden + buttons)

For pick-one-from-many options (e.g. color scheme, mode, shape), use a hidden input plus buttons with `data-value`:

```html
<label>Mode
  <input type="hidden" name="mode" value="city" id="mode">
  <button type="button" data-value="city" title="City">🏢</button>
  <button type="button" data-value="forest" title="Forest">🌲</button>
</label>
```

- The hidden input holds the selected value; use `name` for the options key.
- Each button has `data-value="<value>"` — the engine detects these for automix schema extraction.
- Container: the hidden input must be inside a `label` or a `div` that also contains the buttons (so the engine finds them via `closest("label") || parentElement`).
- On click: set `input.value = btn.dataset.value`, dispatch `change`, and sync button state (opacity, selected class).
- Listen for `optionsApplied` to sync when options are set programmatically (e.g. automix).
- For dynamically created buttons (from a list), use `btn.dataset.value = item.id` (or path, etc.). See Metaball, VideoClips, Particles, BirdsEye, WrapTunnel.

### File inputs

File inputs must NOT be in `options.html` (they cannot pass `File` objects across iframe boundaries). Instead, export `fileInputs` from your visualizer:

```js
export const fileInputs = {
  glb: { accept: ".glb,.gltf", label: "Choose GLB" },
  texture: { accept: "image/*", label: "Texture" },  // multiple supported
};
```

- Each key maps to `options[key]` (e.g. `options.glb`, `options.texture`).
- The engine creates a trigger button in the main app; when the user selects a file, it is passed to `render()` as `options[key]`.
- Multiple file inputs are supported via multiple keys. See `visualizers/glb3d`, `visualizers/Damien` for reference.

### Step by step instructions

 - Create `visualizers/[id]/index.js` that exports `render(canvas, ctx, audio, container, options, engine)` and optionally `cleanup(canvas, container, slot)`.
 - Implement `render`: draw to the provided `canvas`/`ctx`. Use `audio.getByteFrequencyData()` or `audio.analyser.getByteTimeDomainData()` for raw audio; use `audio.kick`, `audio.bass`, `audio.mid`, `audio.high` for pre-filtered values.
 - The engine calls `render` each frame—no `requestAnimationFrame` loop needed.
 - For custom canvases (e.g. Three.js), inject into `container` instead of `document.body`.
 - **State**: Store per-instance state (scene, renderer, etc.) in `container.visualizerState`. Do NOT use module-level variables—the same visualizer can appear multiple times in the manifest and each instance must work independently. In `cleanup`, clear `container.visualizerState` and dispose resources.
 - Add `options.html` for UI controls (toggles, sliders) with `name`/`id` on inputs; values arrive as `options`. For file inputs, use the `fileInputs` export instead.
 - Add the id to `manifest.json`.
 - See `visualizers/SimpleViz`, `Simple3D` for reference.
