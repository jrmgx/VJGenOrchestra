To create/update/work on a new visualizer please follow these instructions:
 - You must render onto the Canvas passed to render(canvas, ctx, analyser, container)
 - Each visualizer renders to its own offscreen canvas; the engine composites all active ones onto the main canvas
 - Prefer transparent backgrounds (clearRect or alpha compositing) so layers blend when multiple visualizers are active
 - Get the audio reactive part from the engine/audio.js (see how ex1 is implemented for reference)
 - For custom canvases (e.g. Three.js), use the container to inject your canvas; the engine will composite it
