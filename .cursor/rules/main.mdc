# Coding rules

This project is already in advanced development stage so:
 - Explore the code and try to use existing Classes, methods, components.
 - Use the same way of doing thing, most of the new feature will be variation of existing one.
 - Refactor often.

IMPORTANT:
 - Do not be too verbose in you code.
 - Find the root cause of bugs, do not try workarounds.
 - Do not implement defensive code by default, keep everything simple.
 - Always double check if your new code can be refactored with existing code.
