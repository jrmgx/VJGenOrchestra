# VJGenOrchestra

Also called VJGO.

Orchestrator for VJ visualizers.<br>
Provides shared building blocks (audio, canvas) and lets users combine multiple visualizers.

The goal is to allow anyone to vibe-code their visualizer idea and easily integrate them with other visualizers to combine things together.

## Guide

This is how you should use this project:

1. First you (vibe) code a standalone visualizer on your own.
2. You integrate your visualizer into the Orchestrator.
3. You play with the Orchestrator (that now contains your visualizer as well as the other ones).
