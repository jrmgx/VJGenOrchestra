<h1>VJGenOrchestra</h1>
<p>Also called VJGO.</p>
<p>Orchestrator for VJ visualizers.<br>
Provides shared building blocks (audio, canvas) and lets users combine multiple visualizers.</p>
<p>The goal is to allow anyone to vibe-code their visualizer idea and easily integrate them with other visualizers to combine things together.</p>
<h2>Guide</h2>
<p>This is how you should use this project:</p>
<ol>
<li>First you (vibe) code a standalone visualizer on your own.</li>
<li>You integrate your visualizer into the Orchestrator.</li>
<li>You play with the Orchestrator (that now contains your visualizer as well as the other ones).</li>
</ol>
