<h1>How to integrate your own visualizer in VJGenOrchestra</h1>
<p>For this part you will need <code>git</code> and a GitHub account.<br>
Cursor App is also recommended.</p>
<h2>Integration</h2>
<p>When your visualizer is working, you should have some files for it.<br>
To integrate it into this project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the VJGenOrchestra source code with <code>git</code></li>
<li>Create a new directory under <code>visualizers</code> with the name you want.</li>
<li>Copy your visualizer files into it.</li>
<li>Prompt something like:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Convert the visualizer in <strong>DIR</strong> so it works with VJGenOrchestra engine /convert-to-visualizer</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best App to do that would be Cursor.com as some skills have been written to help it do the job.<br>
If needed you can use the rules for your own tool, they are in <code>.cursor/skills</code></p>
<h2>Contribution</h2>
<p>To publish your visualizer to the project, you should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a <code>git branch</code> with your visualizer name</li>
<li>Commit your changes to it</li>
<li>Push the branch back to GitHub</li>
</ol>
