Then open <strong>Audio MIDI Setup</strong> and create a <strong>Multi-Output Device</strong> that includes Blackhole and your speakers.<br>
This App will allow you to route your sound to a virtual microphone and then use it into your web browser where you have VJGO started.</p>
<h2>User Interface</h2>
<p>Keyboard shortcut that are shown on the user interface are accessible with <code>ctrl</code> key + symbol.</p>
<p>VJGenOrchestra has three main parts: the <strong>visualizer list</strong> (left), the <strong>options panel</strong> (top right), and the <strong>bottom panel</strong>.</p>
<h3>Visualizer list</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blend mode:</strong> How layers are combined (Normal, Lighten, etc.). Use <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>-</code> / <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>+</code> to cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Effect buttons:</strong> Click to toggle visualizers and post-processors on/off. Active effects show a green underline.</li>
<li><strong>Drag &amp; Drop:</strong> Drag to reorder. Order = compositing order (first = bottom layer).</li>
<li><strong>Shortcuts:</strong> <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>1</code> … <code>Ctrl</code>+<code>0</code> toggles the first 10 effects.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Options panel</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Options:</strong> Shows/hides the options box. When visible, each active effect has a collapsible section with its controls (sliders, colors, etc.). File inputs appear as trigger buttons.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bottom panel</h3>
<p><strong>Audio (left):</strong> Kick detection tuning. <strong>Bass | Mid | High</strong> bars show frequency levels.
Green line = min level; bass must be above it.
Rise strip = bass jump; orange line = min rise.
Kick triggers when both thresholds pass.
<strong>Sliders:</strong> Min level (filter noise), Min rise (sensitivity to jumps), Hold time (how long kick stays on).</p>
<p><strong>Automix (right) — BETA:</strong> Checkbox to enable.
Multi-select lists define which visualizers and post-processors automix can turn on/off.
On each kick (with cooldown), it makes incremental changes: randomly toggles some effects and randomizes their options.</p>
